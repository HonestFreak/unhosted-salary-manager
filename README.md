# Documentation for PayrollManager Module

## Overview

The PayrollManager is a smart contract module designed for integration with the Unhosted Wallet, specifically tailored for managing employee payrolls in a decentralized environment. This module provides a streamlined and secure way to handle payroll operations including adding, removing, updating salaries, and processing payments for employees.

## Features

- **Employee Management**: Add and remove employees from the payroll system.
- **Salary Management**: Update employee salaries as required.
- **Salary Payments**: Process monthly salary payments and bonus payments.
- **Batch Payments**: Pay all active employees at once with the `payAllSalaries` function.
- **Security**: Inherits from OpenZeppelin's Ownable, ensuring that only the owner (employer) can manage employees and their salaries.
- **Transparency and Trust**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust in the payroll process.

## Setup and Integration

### Prerequisites

- A wallet with Ethereum for deploying the contract.
- An Ethereum network (Mainnet or Testnet) connection.
- A development environment like Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle.

### Deployment

1. **Compile the Contract**: Using a Solidity compiler (v0.8.2 - v0.9.0), compile the `PayrollManager` contract.
2. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the contract to your chosen Ethereum network. This can be done using Remix for a simple setup or through Hardhat/Truffle for more advanced options.
3. **Verify Ownership**: Ensure the deploying account is set as the owner, enabling control over the contract.

### Integration with Unhosted Wallet

1. **Enable the Module**: After deployment, the `PayrollManager` contract needs to be enabled as a module in the Unhosted Wallet.
2. **Interface Setup**: Set up the interface in the Unhosted Wallet to interact with the `PayrollManager` functions.
3. **Testing**: Test the integration in a controlled environment (like a Testnet) to ensure everything functions as expected.

## Functions

- `addEmployee(address _employee, uint256 _salary)`: Add a new employee with their salary.
- `removeEmployee(address _employee)`: Remove an existing employee from the payroll.
- `updateSalary(address _employee, uint256 _newSalary)`: Update the salary of an existing employee.
- `paySalary(address _employee)`: Pay the monthly salary to a specific employee.
- `bonus(address _employee)`: Pay a bonus to a specific employee.
- `payAllSalaries()`: Pay all active employees their monthly salary in one transaction.
- `withdraw(uint256 _amount)`: Withdraw funds from the contract.
- `checkBalance()`: Check the contract's current balance.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Conduct thorough unit tests covering each function of the contract.
- **Testnet Deployment**: Deploy the contract to an Ethereum testnet and perform live tests.
- **Security Audits**: Prior to mainnet deployment, consider conducting a security audit.

## Security Considerations

- **Reentrancy Guard**: Ensure protection against reentrancy attacks.
- **Access Control**: Functions that can alter the state of the contract are protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier.
- **Gas Optimization**: Optimize functions for gas efficiency to reduce transaction costs.

## Conclusion

The PayrollManager module offers a decentralized solution for managing employee payrolls. By leveraging blockchain technology, it ensures transparency, security, and efficiency in handling payroll operations.
